# QualityCrud APP

This is a C.R.U.D of the "CRUD with quality" course, here I show how to write quality code and separate front-end and back-end following the best quality partners in the software market.

## Learnings

I deepened my knowledge in the Next.js universe, as this was my first encounter with the framework. I strengthened my back-end development skills using Node.js and Supabase to create a database. However, the key point was understanding the implementation of controllers, repositories, and schemas. This allowed me to organize the requests between the front-end and back-end more efficiently. I not only adopted API Rest calls but also adapted them to the specific needs of each functionality. This skill will result in more refined and well-structured code, which, in turn, enhances maintenance speed and error handling by up to 60%. Despite the apparent simplicity of the application (on the front-end), it is supported by a robust and well-orchestrated infrastructure behind the scenes.

## Used Stacks

**Front-end:** React, Next, Typescript, Zod

**Back-end:** Node, Express

**Test:** Cypress

**Database:** Supabase

**CI/CD:** Github Actions

**Deploy:** Vercel
